# 👨🏾‍🍳 LET HIM COOK — OLA IS IN THE KITCHEN

Welcome to my corner of GitHub.  
I write JavaScript like Jollof rice: **hot, structured, and with correct seasoning.** 🌶️🔥  
New to Git, but **not new to cooking great code**.

---

## 🍲 CURRENTLY COOKING
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Web apps that actually work (most times 😅)
- Git & GitHub (learning the rituals like a fresh apprentice)
- Clean code… except when debugging by fire & by force

---

## ⚒️ KITCHEN TOOLS
- JavaScript  
- Node.js  
- HTML & CSS  
- APIs  
- Git & GitHub  
- VS Code  
- console.log() (my CCTV camera)

---

## 😂 FUN FACTS
- I break code fast.  
- I fix it faster.  
- Then I pretend it was intentional. 😌

---

## 🚀 GOALS
- Become a JavaScript beast 💪🏾  
- Build real-life projects  
- Collaborate with devs worldwide  
- Push code that doesn’t embarrass me in public 😭
